# Code of Conduct for the "Amateur Radio Enthusiasts" Webring

Welcome to the "Amateur Radio Enthusiasts" Webring! We're a community of signal chasers, antenna builders, and static appreciators who share a passion for amateur radio. To keep our corner of the internet harmonious and welcoming, we‚Äôve laid out some ground rules to guide interactions on our site.

1. Keep It Respectful
This isn‚Äôt a contest for the snappiest comeback. Treat fellow enthusiasts with respect, even if their favorite frequency is wildly different from yours. Disagree politely and remember that we're here to connect, not to cause QRM (interference).

2. Celebrate All Experience Levels
Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned Extra-class operator or someone who just figured out what "CQ" means, this space is for everyone. Offer guidance, not judgment, and avoid making newcomers feel like they need a PhD in RF theory to participate.

3. No Lid Behavior
"Lid behavior" includes trolling, spamming, or hogging the conversation with unproductive chatter. If you wouldn‚Äôt do it on-air, don‚Äôt do it here.

4. Stay on Topic
This webring is all about amateur radio. Antennas, propagation, transceivers, and the occasional debate over digital vs. analog modes are fair game. Cats walking on your rig? Hilarious. Detailed discussions of last night‚Äôs chili recipe? Maybe save that for a different venue.

5. Practice Digital Etiquette
When sharing files, links, or images, ensure they are relevant, legal, and virus-free. Nobody likes surprise QRM in their downloads.

6. Signal Boost Good Vibes
Encourage others by sharing your knowledge, celebrating achievements (did you finally work that rare DX? Congrats!), and being a positive voice in the community. Good vibes are as contagious as a perfectly tuned CW signal.

7. Mind the Rules of the Airwaves
This is a global community, so respect the laws and regulations of amateur radio in your and others' countries. No one wants to be the reason someone else‚Äôs license is revoked.

8. No Politics or Controversy
Just like on-air operations, we steer clear of political and divisive discussions here. Keep the chat about oscillators, not opinions.

9. When in Doubt, 73 It Out
Feeling frustrated or misinterpreted? Step back, take a deep breath, and sign off for a bit. We all have our bad propagation days.

10. Report QRM
If you encounter behavior that doesn‚Äôt align with our Code of Conduct, let the site moderators know. We're here to ensure this community stays as friendly and fun as a perfectly tuned pileup.

By joining this webring, you agree to abide by these guidelines. Let‚Äôs keep the airwaves‚Äîand this community‚Äîclear and welcoming. 73 and happy keying! üéôÔ∏è
